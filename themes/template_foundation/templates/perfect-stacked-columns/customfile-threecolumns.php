				<h2>Combining column variations</h2>
				<p>The five styles of columns in this design series can be combined into new layouts by stacking the columns on top of each other. Any number of columns can be stacked and they can be in any order. The number of possibilities are endless.</p>
				<p>Simply include the style rules for each type of column layout used on the page. The CSS has been designed so it is easy to add and remove them.</p>
				<p>See the main page on each column variation for dimensions, nested div structures and positioning.</p>
				<!-- Column 1 end -->

			<div class="col2">
				<!-- Column 2 start -->
				<h2>No CSS hacks</h2>
				<p>The CSS used for this layout is 100% valid and hack free. To overcome Internet Explorer's broken box model, no horizontal padding or margins are used. Instead, this design uses percentage widths and clever relative positioning.</p>
				<!-- Column 2 end -->

				<!-- Column 3 start -->
				<h2>SEO friendly</h2>
				<p>The higher up content is in your page code, the more important it is considered by search engine algorithms. To make your website as optimised as possible your main page content must come before the side column content. Each of the column stacks follow this principle, see the main page for each one for more information.</p>
