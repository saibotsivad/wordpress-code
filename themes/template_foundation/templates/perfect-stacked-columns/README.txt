THIS TEMPLATE NOT FOR THE WEAK HEARTED.

This template is a little different, since you can decide for each row how many columns you want to have.

PLEASE look at (and read) the example page on MatthewJamesTaylor.com to see what the layout looks like, and then read
through the source code to get an even better idea of what he is doing.

The basic idea is this: There are six row styles which mirror six of the template layouts:
1) 2 column double page
2) 2 column left menu
3) 2 column right menu
4) 3 column
5) 3 column blog style (2 right columns that are thinner)
6) split page 3 column

For each row, you will have to decide how many columns you want. You do this by specifying the row class, and then
you need to further specify the classes of interior elements.

To make things "easier", I made six custom files to mirror the six column layouts listed above. You will notice
that the index.php gile really has not HTML in it. This is because of the HTML structure.

I wasn't sure at all how to make this one into a template, so I left it pretty bare.

Any ideas are very welcome, you can email them to me and I may include them in the next update: tobias@davistobias.com
