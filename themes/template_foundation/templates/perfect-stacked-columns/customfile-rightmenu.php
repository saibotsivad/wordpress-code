			<h2>Good uses of a stacked column layout</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Shopping websites</strong> with merchandised units or products in a grid-like layout.</li>
				<li><strong>News websites</strong> with stories grouped by genre into separate sections of the page.</li>
				<li><strong>Large blogs</strong> with lots of different content.</li>
				<li><strong>Business websites</strong> that need to hold a lot of information on the one page.</li>
				<li>And many more...</li>
			</ul>
			<!-- Column 1 end -->

		<div class="col2">
			<!-- Column 2 start -->
			<h2>No Images</h2>
			<p>This layout requires no images. Many CSS website designs need images to colour in the column backgrounds but that is not necessary with this design. Why wast bandwidth and precious HTTP requests when you can do everything in pure CSS and XHTML?</p>
