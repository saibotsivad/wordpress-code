		<p>That's right, you don't have to pay anything. Simply view the source of this page and save the HTML onto your computer. My only suggestion is to <a href="http://matthewjamestaylor.com/blog/adding-css-to-html-with-link-embed-inline-and-import">put the CSS into a separate file</a>. If you are feeling generous however, link back to this page so other people can find and use this layout too.</p>
