			<h2>Valid XHTML strict markup</h2>
			<p>The HTML in this layout validates as XHTML 1.0 strict.</p>
			<h2>Resizable text compatible</h2>
			<p>This layout is fully compatible with resizable text. Resizable text is important for web accessibility. People who are vision impaired can make the text larger so it's easier for them to read. It is becoming increasingly more important to make your website resizable text compatible because people are expecting higher levels of web accessibility. Apple have made resizing the text on a website simple with the pinch gesture on their multi-touch trackpad. So far this trackpad is only available on the MacBook Air but it will soon be rolled out to all of their systems. Is your website text-resizing compatible?</p>
			<h2>No Quirks Mode</h2>
			<p>This liquid layout does not require the XML declaration for it to display correctly in older versions of Internet Explorer. This version works without it and is thus never in quirks mode.</p>
			<h2>No IE Conditional Comments</h2>
			<p>Only one stylesheet is used with this layout This means that IE conditional comments are not needed to set extra CSS rules for older versions of Internet Explorer.</p>
