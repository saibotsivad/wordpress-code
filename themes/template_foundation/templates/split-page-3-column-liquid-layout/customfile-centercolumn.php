					<h2>The nested div structure</h2>
					<p>I've colour coded each div so it's easy to see:</p>
					<img src="http://matthewjamestaylor.com/blog/split-page-3-column-div-structure.gif" width="278" height="369" alt="3 Column 'Split Page' CSS Liquid-Layout" />
					<p>The header, colmask and footer divs are 100% wide and stacked vertically one after the other. Colmid is inside colmask and colright is inside colmid. The left and right content columns each have their own wrapper div and are inside colright. The center column does not need a wrapper and it is the last div in colright. Notice that the left and right content columns come before the center column, this is great for SEO.</p>
					<h2>No CSS hacks</h2>
					<p>The CSS used for this layout is 100% valid and hack free. To overcome Internet Explorer's broken box model, no horizontal padding or margins are used. Instead, this design uses pixel widths and clever relative positioning.</p>
					<h2>Valid XHTML strict markup</h2>
					<p>The HTML in this layout validates as XHTML 1.0 strict.</p>
					<h2>Resizable text compatible</h2>
					<p>This layout is fully compatible with resizable text. Resizable text is important for web accessibility. People who are vision impaired can make the text larger so it's easier for them to read. It is becoming increasingly more important to make your website resizable text compatible because people are expecting higher levels of web accessibility. Apple have made resizing the text on a website simple with the pinch gesture on their multi-touch trackpad. So far this trackpad is only available on the MacBook Air but it will soon be rolled out to all of their systems. Is your website text-resizing compatible?</p>
					<h2>This layout is FREE for anyone to use</h2>
					<p>You don't have to pay anything. Simply view the source of this page and save the HTML onto your computer. My only suggestion is to put the CSS into a separate file. If you are feeling generous however, link back to this page so other people can find and use this layout too.</p>
