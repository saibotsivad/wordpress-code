					<h2>Pixel dimensions of the Split Page layout</h2>
					<img src="http://matthewjamestaylor.com/blog/split-page-3-column-dimensions.gif" width="276" height="370" alt="Split Page 3 column layout dimensions" />
					<p>In this layout the center column width is in pixels and the left and right columns adjust in size to fill the rest of the screen. Vertical dimensions are left unset so they automatically stretch to the height of the content. Layouts that use pixel widths are great for images because you can make them fit perfectly within a column without gaps.</p>
					<h2>SEO friendly 1-3-2 column ordering</h2>
					<p>The higher up content is in your page code, the more important it is considered by search engine algorithms. To make your website as optimised as possible your main content must come before secondary content. This layout does exactly that: The left column comes first, then the right column and finally the narrow center column (see the nested div structure diagram for more info).</p>
					<h2>Equal height columns</h2>
					<p>It doesn't matter which column has the longest content, the background colour of all columns will stretch down to meet the footer. This feature was traditionally only available with table based layouts but now with a little CSS trickery we can do exactly the same with divs. Say goodbye to annoying short columns!</p>
					<h2>No Images</h2>
					<p>This layout requires no images. Many CSS website designs need images to colour in the column backgrounds but that is not necessary with this design. Why waste bandwidth and precious HTTP requests when you can do everything in pure CSS and XHTML?</p>
					<h2>No JavaScript</h2>
					<p>JavaScript is not required. Some website layouts rely on JavaScript hacks to resize divs and force elements into place but you won't see any of that nonsense here.</p>
